# pbjs polyfills
This will proberly be in the pb core, since its commenly used. JSON should be optional or maybe use another library? The previous pbjs wasn't that safe..

## Date
### Date.now

## Function
### bind

## Object
### keys

## Array
Should we add this? Or suggst to include ecma5/html5 polyfill like html5shiv

## JSON
### stringify
### parse
